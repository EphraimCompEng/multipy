This project was initially focused on how [saturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_arithmetic) allows for the optimisation of a combinational [multiplier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_multiplier). Once saturation is introduced, calculating the ceiling, or overflow, becomes extremely fast for one range of inputs. Another range always produces values within the extremes. The remaining range of inputs may or may not fall outside the extremes. Finding ways to predict if a given input results in an overflow, as early as possible, will result in faster calculations.






# Saturation

A combinational multiplier starts by creating all possible partial products. Then, reduces the number of partial products across multiple stages, eventually all products are reduced to one output.

For example, using a [Wallice tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallice_tree)  to multiply 11 * 12: 

```
11 * 12 -> 0b1011 * 0b1100
```

Can be represented like so:
```
        1011
   [____0000] 0
   [___0000_] 0
   [__1011__] 1
   [_1011___] 1
   ----------
0b [10000100] -> 132
```

This is oversimplified and only 4-bit, but you get the idea.

Note that for any multiplication the output can be upto **2x** the input width.


##

Using the 11 * 12 example above, if the output was saturated to 4-bits, the result would be 15 since the maximum value is 0b1111 -> 15.
Typically, saturation restricts the output bit width to the input bit width.

    Here are scenarios I want to like to test:

    Type I
    a) Input values < 255
    b) Input pairs which do not cross overflow threshold during
       AND-matrix

       overflow|valid
       --------+-----------
        -------|00000000
        ------0|0000000-
        -----00|000000--
        ----000|00000---
        ---0000|0000----
        --00000|000-----
        -000000|00------
        0000000|0-------

    c) Input pairs which overflow in partial product reduction
