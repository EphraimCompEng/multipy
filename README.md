# MultiPy

A powerful tool to build, test, and analyse multiplier designs.


# Why?

Generating and analysing multiplier designs by hand is labour intensive, even for small datasets, for entire [truth tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table), this is close to impossible.

MultiPy provides tools for:

- Building partial product reduction layers
- Generating truth tables for custom algorithms
- Analysis, plotting, and finding trends across a dataset(s)
- Fine-grain access to bits, words or stages when building or analysing


# Documentation

Documentation will added as the project progresses, including usage, general theory and implementations of algorithms using MultiPy.
